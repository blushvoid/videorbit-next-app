      <b>Applicability of these General Conditions</b> <br />
      <br />
      1.1 These conditions apply, to the exclusion of any other conditions, to
      all offers, agreements and deliveries regarding products created or
      offered by the Designer. <br />
      1.2 The following definitions are used in these General Conditions:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Designer the design agency that or the designer who sells products;{" "}
        </li>
        <li>Buyer the Designer’s counterparty; </li>
        <li>
          Consumer a Buyer not acting in the conduct of a profession or
          business;{" "}
        </li>
        <li>Consumer Purchase a purchase between a Designer and a Consumer;</li>
        <li>
          Distant Purchase a Consumer or Buyer Purchase whereby the agreement is
          concluded via the Internet or by telephone, fax or post.{" "}
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Offers and agreements</b> <br />
      2.1 An offer or quotation will be valid during the 14 days. <br />
      2.2 In the case of distance selling, agreements between the Designer and
      the Buyer will be concluded on acceptance of the offer by the Buyer and
      compliance with the stipulated conditions. <br />
      2.3 The Designer will have the right to make use of third parties in the
      performance of the agreement. Any and all rights and claims stipulated in
      these Conditions and in any further agreements for the benefit of the
      Designer will equally apply to any agents and other third parties engaged
      by the Designer. <br />
      <br />
      <b>Price adjustments </b>
      <br />
      3.1 If the prices of raw materials or wages, import duties, taxes or other
      external costs increase after the conclusion of the agreement (whether or
      not due to currency fluctuations), the Designer will have the right to
      adjust the purchase price to that increase. <br />
      3.2 The Designer must inform the Buyer of such a circumstance as soon as
      possible, after which the Buyer will have the right to dissolve the
      agreement, unless it has been stipulated that the delivery will take place
      more than three (3) months after the purchase or the increase is due to a
      statutory price increase. <br />
      <br />
      <b>Delivery </b>
      <br />
      4.1 The Designer will state a delivery period. Specified delivery and
      other terms will not be of the essence, unless otherwise expressly agreed
      in writing. If a term is exceeded, the buyer must provide a further term
      in which to deliver. If that term is also exceeded, the buyer may dissolve
      the agreement. <br />
      4.2 If the Designer requires information from the Buyer for the
      performance of the agreement, or if full or partial payment in advance has
      been stipulated, the delivery term will not commence until the Designer
      has received the correct and full information or the payment in advance.
      <br /> 4.3 Delivery to buyer will take place in the manner stated by the
      Designer during the purchase process and at the (email)address stated by
      the Buyer upon the conclusion of the agreement. The risk in the products
      delivered will pass to the Buyer on the moment of delivery. <br />
      4.4 If the Buyer refuses to take delivery, the Designer may charge him the
      resulting costs. In that case the Designer will also have the right to
      dissolve the agreement, without prejudice to his right to claim full
      damages. <br />
      <br />
      <b>Retention of title</b> <br />
      All products delivered will remain the Designer’s property until the Buyer
      has fulfilled all his obligations towards the Designer under the
      agreement. <br />
      <br />
      <b>Dissolution and return of products</b>
      <br />
      6.1 After the order has been confirmed, the Buyer may amend or cancel it
      only with the Designer’s prior consent. If the Designer has already
      incurred costs or will incur costs as a result of the amendment or
      cancellation, the Designer may charge those cost to the Buyer. <br />
      6.2 Products delivered may be returned only with the Designer’s prior
      written consent, in the manner stated by the Designer during the purchase
      process. The direct costs involved in the return shipment of the products
      in the context of this Article will be payable by the Buyer, unless
      otherwise expressly agreed in writing. <br />
      <br />
      <b>Payment </b>
      <br />
      7.1 The Designer may at any time demand full or partial payment in advance
      or cash on delivery. <br />
      7.2 If products are delivered on account (invoice), the invoice amount
      must be paid within fourteen (14) days, without the Buyer being entitled
      to any discount or setoff.
      <br /> 7.3 If the Designer has not received (full) payment at the end of
      the payment period, the Buyer will be in default and will owe interest
      equal to the statutory interest rate that applies to consumer
      transactions. All costs incurred by the Designer in connection with late
      payment, such as procedural costs and judicial and extrajudicial costs,
      including the costs of legal assistance, bailiffs and debt collection
      agencies, will be payable by the Buyer. The extrajudicial costs will be
      charged on the basis of the Extrajudicial Collection Costs Decree. The
      fees in that Decree are:
      <ul>
        <li>Minimum rate €40 </li>
        <li>15% on the first €2,500</li>
        <li>10% on the next €2,500</li>
        <li>5% on the next €5,000</li>
        <li>1% on the next €190,000</li>
        <li>
          0.5% on the excess of the principal, subject to a maximum of €6,775
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      7.4 Before charging collection costs, the Designer will send the consumer
      a demand for payment (reminder) in which the Designer is given a period of
      fourteen (14) days after the day of the demand for payment inn which to
      pay the claim after all. <br />
      <br />
      <b>Right of suspension and dissolution </b>
      <br />
      8.1 In addition to the provisions regarding force majeure and the
      provisions of Article 6, the Designer will have the right to suspend (in
      full or in part) the performance of its obligations under all agreements
      that exist between the parties or to dissolve those agreements in full or
      in part without any notice of default or judicial intervention being
      required: if the Buyer is in default or the Designer has good reason to
      believe that the Buyer will not perform its obligations in full and/or in
      time; in the event of liquidation, a suspension of payment, a petition for
      a suspension of payment, bankruptcy or debt rescheduling, or any other
      circumstance as a result of which the Buyer can no longer freely dispose
      of its capital; or if circumstances occur as a result of which it is
      impossible to perform the agreement or the Designer cannot reasonably be
      required to continue the agreement in an unamended form. <br />
      8.2 In the cases referred to in paragraph 8.1 any obligations of the Buyer
      will furthermore fall due immediately and the Designer will not be
      required to pay any damages. The latter will not apply in the event of
      dissolution on the grounds of circumstances for which the Consumer cannot
      be blamed. <br />
      <br />
      <b>Guarantees and complaints</b> <br />
      9.1 The products to be supplied by the Designer will meet the customer
      requirements and standards that can reasonably be set at the moment of
      delivery and for which they are intended in the event of normal use. If
      applicable, guarantee provisions of suppliers and third parties, such as
      producers and importers, will apply to the products supplied by the
      Designer. <br />
      9.2 If the product is used outside the Netherlands, the Buyer itself must
      verify whether the products are suitable for use there and whether they
      meet the conditions and the applicable statutory and other requirements.{" "}
      <br />
      9.3 The Buyer will be required to inspect the products delivered
      immediately after receipt. Any defects established must be reported to the
      Designer in writing, stating the reasons, within two (2) months or in the
      case of external defects immediately. <br />
      9.4 If it has been proven that a product is not in conformity with the
      agreement and the complaint was filed in a timely manner, the Designer
      may, at its option, replace the product in question, arrange for repairs,
      or refund the invoice price plus any shipping costs paid. <br />
      9.5 All data, designs and images regarding colours, materials, dimensions
      and finishing will be for information purposes only. Divergences will not
      be reason for rejection, discount, dissolution of the agreement or damages
      if such divergences are minor.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Intellectual property rights</b> <br />
      10.1 The Buyer expressly acknowledges that all intellectual and/or
      industrial property rights in respect of the products, materials and
      information made available to the Buyer by the Designer, including
      samples, packaging, labels and designs (and their appearance), the
      composition and/or specifications of samples, products and semi-finished
      products, as well as technical and commercial know-how, models, moulds,
      designs and patterns, rest with the Designer, its supplier or other
      parties entitled. <br />
      10.2 If and insofar as the Designer manufactures products or packaging on
      the basis of express instructions given by the Buyer, such as
      specifications, designs, sketches, models or patterns provided by the
      Buyer, the Buyer warrants that no third-party rights will be infringed.
      The Buyer indemnifies the Designer against any third-party claims in this
      context and will reimburse all costs incurred by the Designer in
      connection with such claims. <br/><br/><b>Liability for damage</b> <br />
      11.1 The Designer will not be liable for damage caused:
      <ol>
        <li>
          by incompetent use of the products delivered or use for a purpose
          other than that for which they are suitable by objective standards;{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          {" "}
          because the Designer used incorrect or incomplete data provided by or
          on behalf of the Buyer;{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          third parties engaged in a performance of the agreement at the Buyer’s
          request or with the Buyer’s consent;{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          materials or services provided by third parties at the Buyer’s request
          or with the Buyer’s consent;
        </li>
        <li>
          or misunderstandings, damage, delays or the improper receipt of orders
          and notifications due to the use of the Internet or any other means of
          communication (whether or not electronic).{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Only direct loss attributable to the Designer will qualify for
              compensation. Any and all liability for indirect loss, including
              but not limited to consequential loss, loss of profits, damaged or
              lost data or materials, and loss of proceeds is excluded. In the
              case of Consumer Purchase the scope of this provision will be
              limited to that permitted under Article 7:24(2) of the Dutch Civil
              Code.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              Insofar as the Designer is liable for the reimbursement of loss,
              that loss will be limited to the invoice amount for the delivery
              or partial delivery in question.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              The Buyer indemnifies the Designer against any and all claims from
              third parties that incur losses in connection with the performance
              of the agreement and for the cause of which the Buyer is to blame.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              The limitations recorded in Article 11.1 to 11.14 will not apply:{" "}
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          if the loss is due to intent or gross negligence on the part of the
          Designer or its executive or non-executive subordinates;{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          in the event of product liability towards a Consumer within the
          meaning of Book 6, Part 3, Chapter 3, of the Dutch Civil Code.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <b>Force majeure</b> <br />
      12.1 If the Designer is unable to perform the agreement due to an event of
      force majeure, it will have the right to suspend its obligations until the
      event of force majeure has ended. If that period lasts longer than two (2)
      months, either of the parties will have the right to dissolve the
      agreement in respect of the products affected by the event of force
      majeure, without being required to compensate the loss incurred by the
      other party. In that case the Buyer will be required to pay for the
      products already delivered. <br />
      12.2 In these General Conditions, ‘force majeure’ means, among other
      things, in addition to the definition of that term in the law and in case
      law, all external causes beyond the Designer’s control, either foreseen or
      unforeseen, as a result of which the Designer is unable to fulfil its
      obligations.
      <br /> <br />
      <b>Dutch law and competent court</b> <br />
      13.1 This Agreement is governed by Dutch law, also if an obligation is
      performed abroad in full or in part or if the Buyer has its place of
      residence there. The applicability of the Vienna Sales Convention is
      excluded. <br />
      13.2 In the event of disputes, the court of the Buyer’s place of residence
      will be the competent court. <br />
      13.3 The parties will submit a dispute to the court only after they have
      made every effort to settle the dispute in consultation.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Other provisions</b>
      <br />
      14.1 Amendments and/or additions to these General Conditions will be valid
      and applicable only if recorded in writing. If the Designer uses
      additional conditions or any provisions that conflict with these General
      Conditions, that will not affect the validity and applicability of other
      provisions of these General Conditions.
